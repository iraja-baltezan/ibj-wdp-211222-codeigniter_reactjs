/**
 * LocalStorage.js:
 * This contains helper functions for retrieving and saving data via
 * LocalStorage.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * For the sake of brevity, we use LocalStorage for Global State Management.
 * This may not be in line with global best practices. Please consider
 * alternatives like Redux, Mobx or using the useContext and useReducer React
 * Hooks. These will add considerable complexity to the tutorial hence the
 * oversimplification.
